When I was in univeristy. I took part in many electronic technology competitions.
In the first semester of sophomore year(2013), I got the second prize at Chongqing College student programming Competition , and won the second prize at Chongqing College student mobile robot Competition.
In the second semester of sophomore year(2014), I won the first prize at National Bochuang cup smart car finals; Meanwhile, I also got the second prize at Chongqing Ti Cup Electronic Design Competition.
In the junior year(2014-2015), I got second prize of Chongqing at National College Students Mathematical Contest in Modeling.
In the senior year(2015-2016), I studied at Tsinghua university as an exchange student learning speech recognition.  And I did research about how to use data paralle to speed up training in Kaldi.

### Graduate student (2017-2020)

In 2017, I went to Capital Normal University that Mathemathics is the so-called Double first-class discipline. At there, I took three mathematics courses for mathematics graduate, whicha are Differential Geometry, Abstract Algebra, Parital Differential Equation. Here is my [Transcript](https://github.com/tanghui-cslt/tanghui-cslt.github.io/blob/master/transcript.pdf).
